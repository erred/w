Handrolled, artisanal blog.
Lovingly made from scratch.
Decorated with hair torn out from trying to get things to work.

### Pipeline

#### Source

Hosted on [Github](https://github.com/seankhliao/com-seankhliao-blog).
Written in markdown (mostly).

#### CI/_CD_

Pushed commits trigger CI/CD on [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/).
Runs custom site generator ([parse markdown](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday), create html).
Pushes results into [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting/).
Extra steps to purge Cloudflare cache.

#### Front End

Dark theme, monospace font, actually sort of what my terminal looks like.
Mostly reused the stylesheet from my [main](https://seankhliao.com) site.

#### Aditional Info

[kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) is used to build containers.
Getting it to respect subdirectory contexts is still confusing
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) is on every page (hopefully).

#### TODO

- make analytics more useful
- trigger [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) archive
- trigger [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) indexing
- figure out pipeline for images
- integrate with main site
- add favicon
- add manifest?
- add serviceworker?
- purge caches
