### _6_ months

I... fiddled with alerting rules (nothing major),
dumped more things into terraform and refactored it a bit,
wrote a helm chart for our "standard microservice",
filed a ticket called "sean don't create more review backlog",
wrote a github bot to do diffs on rendered helm templates,
fiddled with a bunch of permissions,
and filed more tickets for observability struff.

Also spent an inordinate amount of time waiting for code reviews.
Also, cloudflare's api is pretty shitty.
