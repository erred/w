### _contour_ ipv6

So, you've run out of ipv4 addresses and want to start running kubernetes with ipv6.
Anyway, for whatever reason you chose [contour](https://projectcontour.io/) as the ingress controller.
You apply the manifests and...

```sh
» k get pod
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
contour-758d8f4c8-srjbh   0/1     Running   0          10m
envoy-ltz64               1/2     Running   0          10m
```

What could possibly have gone wrong?

```sh
» k describe pod contour-758d8f4c8-srjbh
...
Events:
  ...
  Warning  Unhealthy    3s (x61 over 10m)   kubelet            Readiness probe failed: dial tcp [fd00:10:244::d]:8001: connect: connection refused

» k describe pod envoy-ltz64
...
Events:
  ...
  Warning  Unhealthy         2m4s (x13 over 2m52s)  kubelet            Readiness probe failed: Get "http://[fd00:10:244::c]:8002/ready": dial tcp [fd00:10:244::c]:8002: connect: connection refused
```

connection refused, so the pods aren't listening on the correct addresses?
Anyway the docs don't mention anything about ipv6 yet,
but looking at the [configuration](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.16.0/configuration/),
lets just set all the `--xxx-address=` flags to `::` so we're sure it works on ipv6.
Note all the `""` quoting because... yaml.

```yaml
      containers:
      - args:
        - serve
        - --incluster
        - "--xds-address=::"
        - "--stats-address=::"
        - "--debug-http-address=::"
        - "--http-address=::"
        - "--health-address=::"
        - "--envoy-service-http-address=::"
        - "--envoy-service-https-address=::"
        ...
---
      - args:
        - bootstrap
        - /config/envoy.json
        - "--admin-address=::"

```

So this works.

Anyway, after asking in slack,
this is confirmed to be more or less [the changes needed](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/3284#issuecomment-832114962).
