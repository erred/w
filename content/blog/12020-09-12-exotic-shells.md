### _shell_

Shells, the thing you interact with in a terminal,
parsing your input and executing programs on your behalf.
Maybe you've grown tired of bash and zsh
and yearn for something different.

#### _fish_

[Fish][fish] is probably the most popular (or at least loudest) alternative shell.
With a focus on UX, colors and autosuggestions come by default,
inspiring ports back to zsh (maybe bash?).
Unfortunately not entirely POSIX compliant,
so random scripts are likely to break.

#### _elvish_

[elvish][elvish] is further out than fish in terms of syntax,
but it does mean things like lists are saner.
Interesting things include the ability to pass data structures between elvish functions.
Comes with builtin file manager.

#### _oil_

[Oil][oil] apparently sits somewhere between bash and python.
Best approached from a (programming) language perspective.
Barely documented.
