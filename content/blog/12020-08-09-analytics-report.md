### _Analytics_ report

Got 3+ hours to waste?

Migrate from pure Google Analytics to Google Tag Manager so you can XSS your own site.

Connect Google Search Console to Google Analytics for ???.

Connect both to Google Data Studio to create custom reports,
and despair that the charts put legends in the most inconvenient of places.

#### _Todo_

Waste more time by:

- integrating web-vitals into report
- add recaptcha v3 for bot detection
- add custom user id tracking?
- add referrer / user agent / browser version tracking
