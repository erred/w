months

What did i do this time?

- get an authoritative list of OWNERS for various apps
- cleanup
- disaster recovery planning
- migrating from Pingdom to GCP Uptime
- various security fixes/lockdowns
- try to squeeze some cost optimizations from utilization (not very successful)
- get stuck on asking a third party to change some firewalls (1 month and still not done...)
- audit and updates alerts and on call routing, alertmanager, GCP, OpsGenie
- Service Level X investigations
