title: k8s rollouts

### _rollouts_

So you want to deploy a new version (of some request based service)
of your deployment with some guarantee that it actually works.

This usually comes with 2 parts: rolling out the service
and routing the traffic.

#### _networking_

The k8s Ingress API is the least common denominator,
and the least flexible,
doing simple round robin by the number of backing pods.
So we get a proliferation of CRDs for each API Gateway / Service Mesh
each with similar but different capabilities.
These have the ability to route traffic based on a weight in the routing spec.
Actual canary deployments are done by gradually updating the spec to shift traffic.

- [_k8s_](https://kubernetes.io/) [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/): abuse round robin by maintaining ratios of pods
- [_istio_](https://istio.io/) [VirtualService](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/) (replaces Service): routes take weights
- [_traefik_](https://traefik.io/) [IngressRoute](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/providers/kubernetes-crd/#kind-ingressroute) (replaces Ingress): routes take weights
- [_contour_](https://projectcontour.io/) [HTTPProxy](https://projectcontour.io/docs/v1.10.0/config/request-routing/#upstream-weighting) (replaces Ingress): routes take weights
- [_ambassador_](https://www.getambassador.io/) [Mapping](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/using/canary/#the-weight-attribute) (between Ingress and Service or replaces Ingress): mapping takes weights
- [_gloo_](https://www.solo.io/products/gloo-edge/) [VirtualService](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/guides/traffic_management/destination_types/canary/) (replaces Ingress) and1 Upstream (on top of Service): routes take weights

and more: linkerd, aws app mesh, skipper, nginx, [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) (Service Mesh Interface) [TrafficSplit](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/apis/traffic-split/v1alpha3/traffic-split.md), ...

- [knative](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/) [Service](https://github.com/knative/serving/blob/master/docs/spec/overview.md): requires one of the above, and presents a simplified CRD that replaces Deployment+Service+Ingress

#### _controller_

These are the things that watch for updates and deploy your new version,
handle the routing by updating the above specs
and canary testing before finalizing everything into a stable state,
either a successful deploy of a new version or a rollback to the old.

- [_flagger_](https://flagger.app/) [Canary](https://docs.flagger.app/usage/how-it-works#canary-resource): creates Services and extra Deployments and manipulates ingresses
- [_argo rollouts_](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/) [Rollout](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/specification/): replaces Deployment, manipulates services

Both can do Canaries (progressive traffic shift) and BlueGreen (atomic(?) traffic switch).
Flagger can do header/cookie based routing (A/B Testing) and traffic mirroring (for istio),
both are on the roadmap for Argo Rollouts.
