### _kaniko_

[kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko)
the docker container builder that doesn't require privileges.
Ever wondered how that worked?
Also, why

> - kaniko does not support building Windows containers.
> - Running kaniko in any Docker image other than the official kaniko image is not supported

The reason is kaniko builds itself as a static binary,
so once it's running, it no longer depends on the filesystem
(the same cannot be said for running in windows).
So it's now free to use its own container as the build context container,
extracting base images such as `FROM golang` directly to its own root `/`.
