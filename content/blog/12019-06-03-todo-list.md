### Checklists

Checklists are useful,
the reduce errors and [save lives](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/fall08checklist/)

#### I'll _remember_ to... what?

You might not have dementia,
but remembering things is hard.
Sometimes the most you remember is that you're forgetting _something_,
but what is that something?
Checklists reduce cognitive load
and give you a visual confirmation that everything is done

#### Checklists are fun

Who doesn;t like the sense of accomplishment
from ticking off another line item,
watching the list grow shorter
unitl everything is done?
