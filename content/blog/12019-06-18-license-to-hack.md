### licenses

open source licenses,
a confusing and contentious topic,
some treat it like a religion,
but it should probably be treated as a tool,
choose the _right one for the job_

[choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/appendix/) is a great resource

[tl;dr legal](https://tldrlegal.com/) is also nice

If your goal is to share your work with little care for how it is used,
and not participate in religious evangelism,
