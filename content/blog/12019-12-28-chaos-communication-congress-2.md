title: Chaos Communication Congress Day 2

### Day _2_

Now with a day of experience,
maybe I'll be better at navigating 36c3 / CCC.

#### Life

skip a few talks to listen to Filippo _@FiloSottile_
on [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)
and Go.
Security things start to make more sense

#### Talks

good ones i _highlighted_

##### How to Design Highly Reliable Digital Electronics

_Bzzz_
radiation == bad,
who would've thought.
solutions: do it in parallel and vote.
Maybe some architectural changes but meh.

##### _TamaGo - bare metal Go framework for ARM SoCs_

_Hmmm_
Go protects you from the ravages of stupid OS decisions
so much so it is basically a OS in itself.
So maybe we don't need an OS at all...
Minimal toolchain mods + hardware drivers and initialization
== run Go programs standalone on SoCs

##### The ecosystem is moving

_Sighhh_
The truth,
the internet doesn't accept nuance.
Talk: decentralised introduces more problems from point of view of a service provider.
Other people either still in 90s mentality
**everyone can be a superuser**,
or are handwavy project manager types that appear to understand the tech
but actually only a little and in the wrong way
which is strictly worse than someone who doesn't understand at all.

##### All wireless communication stacks are equally broken

_Check check check_
Yeah we broke this. And this. And this too.
We were bored so this is now also broken.

##### The sustainability of safety, security and privacy

_Okayyy_
Man doesn't trust modern tech (and other people).
Man limits himself to recreating 1980s tech.

##### _ZombieLoad Attack_

_Woooh_
like the plundervolt one,
sweat spot in between entertainig and technical
