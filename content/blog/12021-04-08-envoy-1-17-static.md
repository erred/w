title: envoy 1.17 static
description: sometimes you're just too lazy to setup k8s

### _envoy_

[envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) has somehow made its way to become
the foundational L7 proxy for cloud native stuff.
It shines when it's dynamically configured (usually remotely),
but sometimes a static config is all you need.

Anyway, I need a reverse proxy, so why not try it out.
(I would have used k8s and an ingress but it kills a GCP `f1-micro` instance).

I have 2 static upstreams listening on localhost,
and a wildcard cert through [`acme.sh`](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh)
[`--yes-I-know-dns-manual-mode-enough-go-ahead-please`](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/DNS-manual-mode).
No, I don't _plan_ on keeping this server around long enough to need to renew it.

Anyway, the config is YAML with way too many levels on indentation, but fairly understandable.
There's a wildcard http->https redirect, and 2 virtual hosts.

_note:_ I was originally looking at the latest docs (1.18-rc) which had new stdout logging... it doesn't work on 1.17 (because it's new).
