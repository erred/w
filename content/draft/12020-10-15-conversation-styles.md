Working remotely has once again reminded me of the
[conversational styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Tannen#Conversational_style)
research by Deborah Tannen.

#### _direct_ vs indirect

I know I have to be more direct,
but it's hard when I lack confidence to speak authoritatively.
This is mildly affected by working from home,
the lack of nonverbal cues even with a webcam on
really doesn't help.

#### _involvement_ vs considerateness

The talk over vs talk with vs take your turn conversation styles.
This is sort of broken in working from home,
since you lose the directionality of people speaking,
plus your videoconferencing software may decide to suppress other people
while one is speaking,
and the lossy voice transmission mean you can never really tell
if someone is interrupting or agreeing.
