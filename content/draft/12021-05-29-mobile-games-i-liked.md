### _mobile_ games

Games are a great way to burn a couple of hours
when you just don't want to spend the brainpower to do anything properly.
What i usually look for is something that isn't timer based,
isn't too repetitive while not being overly complex,
and gives a decent feel of progression.

Anyway, these are a few i liked,
with most of the progression coming from the stories.

#### phantom rose scarlett

[Phantom Rose Scarlett](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phantomrosegame.phantomRoseScarlett)

Probably favourite game on the list, mechanics wise.
Collect + dungeon crawl while managing cooldowns.
And love the art style.

#### bistro heroes

[Bistro Heroes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapas.heroesrestaurant)

This is just cute,
does get a bit boring after a while since for any given level
there are a few (more or less) mandatory characters,
leaving you with not much room to do anything differently.

#### destiny child

[Destiny Child](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linegames.dcglobal)

A gacha game, but with what i think is a fairly solid, lighthearted story (voiced!),
and an easy progression allowing you to experience everything without too much of a challenge.
More "pretty" style.

#### arknights

[Arknights](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.YoStarEN.Arknights)

Another gacha game, but with a darker storyline.
The tower defense style is probably the most challenging here gameplay wise,
and i eventually gave up after being stuck somewhere.
Still, the story is worth following(?)
and it was fun while it lasted.
Mix between pretty and cute.
