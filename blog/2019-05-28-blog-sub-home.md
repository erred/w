# Subdomain to _Subdir_

Sure a subdomain is pretty,
and it gives more choices in terms of hosting and infra.
But it also makes things harder,
like SEO, and analytics tracking.

## New Home

So here's the new home @ [seankhliao.com/blog](https://seankhliao.com/blog).
Built with a refactored [static site generator](https://github.com/seankhliao/cloud-build-tools/tree/master/site-builder)
that even makes sitemaps(!)
