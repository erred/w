### 36th _Chaos_ Communication Congress

36c3 (CCC) is apparently an annual meetup of the weird and wonderful.

Lots of _hackers_,
in the broadest definitions of the word.

#### _Queue_ up

Arrived 1905-ish,
queued for maybe 10 minutes and got a _wristband_!
Got a bit confused how to use the wristband
( **so there's a metal thing that gets crimped so you can't take it off** )
but the _angels_ were super helpful

#### Wander _aimlessly_

Leipzig Messe is not small,
people brought scooters / hoverboards / rollerskates?
Should definitely consider.

Not everything is setup yet but starting to see RGB glowing things
