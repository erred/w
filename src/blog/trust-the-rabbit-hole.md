#### How _(not)_ to trust everything

So you want a trusted compute platform?

Who do you trust?
Your _hardware_, the hidden OSes running on your hardware
your boot process, your OS,
the software running in the OS,
the software you are running,
also everything they trust
commonly known as `/etc/ca-certificates` if you're connecting to the web,
and the services your software connects to.

So a lot of things
