too many people try to get in

FOSDEM, the free open source conference.
Unfortunately, it's free so everyone tried to get in.
For some reason some of the really popular talks are in _tiny_ rooms,
leading to a _pile_ of people outside.
At least Go got one of the bigger ones.
If you really want to get in a talk,
be prepared to arrive 1 talk earlier and maybe sit through
something you're not that interested in.

## Key takeaways

- if you want to go, have a really strong game plan
- or just go to meet people, talks can wait for videos
- Jaana is amazing as always
