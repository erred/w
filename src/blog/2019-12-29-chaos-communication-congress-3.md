### Day _3_

Who wouldn't want to pull an _18-hour_ day at 36c3?
With all the excitement, you don't want to miss out.

#### Life at CCC

skipped a few talks for dinner,
still don't know if it was a good idea

1 beer + 2 cocktails over a long time,
I'm fine

Dancing: I can really only do a bad imitation of it

5am? yeah sure.

#### Talks

good ones i _highlighted_

##### A systematic evaluation of OpenBSD's mitigations

_Uhhhh_
Man does limited research on project as outsider.
Man doesn't get insider to review talk.
Man gives talk with clickbait title.
Man can't answer questions.

##### Build you own Quantum Computer @ Home - 99% of discount - Hacker Style!

_Mmm-hmmm_
Building old style quantum register isn't too hard.
Building more than register: too be seen.
At least it's entertaining

##### _Wifibroadcast_

_Interesting_
If you have these specific hardware,
you can override everything and blast micowaves through the sky.
Maybe you'll also get a one way data signal through

##### Quantum computing: are we there yet?

_Ehhhh_
Google quantum supremecy: good benchmark.
Practical quantum attack: some time away.
AWS Braket (quantum compute): different process, meh on quantumness

##### High-assurance crypto software

_Yeeaahhhh_
Software is buggy,
who would've thought

##### Boot2root

_Yep_
black box proprietary things have lots of bugs.

##### _Hacking (with) a TPM_

_I have ideas_
so TPM is usable, __mostly__, probably.
I need to implement this

##### Linux on Open Source Hardware with Open Source chip design

_Sighhh_
spend $1000 now or wait maybe a year for sub $100 RISCV board
