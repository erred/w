### notes

On an otherwise _wasted_ day with no concrete output

#### arch repositories

Given a `PKGBUILD`,
`makepkg` to package it,
`repo-add` to add it to a `database.db.tar`,
save in the same flat directory

#### archlinux as a container base image

There is an official image at [archlinux/base](https://hub.docker.com/r/archlinux/base/)

If you insist on diy: review [pacstrap](https://git.archlinux.org/arch-install-scripts.git/tree/pacstrap.in)
basically mkdirs,
then `pacman -r $root -Syu pacman`
(pacman depends on everything you will ever need...)

#### kaniko FROM scratch

kaniko/executor has different behaviour from docker build
it mounts `docker.sock` into the container and uses more symlinks
`COPY --from=build /build /` in s scratch container works in docker but not kaniko
