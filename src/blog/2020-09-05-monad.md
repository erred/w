### _monads_

Weird concept thrown around by functional programming purists.

Basically, it is:

- a wrapper around any datatype/object/thing
- a way to wrap the datatype/object/thing
- a way to apply a function to the underlying datatype/object/thing

#### _constructor_

Your monad type is `Wrap`.

Your data type is `Foo`.

Your resulting type is `Wrap{Foo}` (or whatever notation you understand better).

#### _converter_

Also known as _return_ or _unit_.

Your data type is `Foo`, and your data object is `foo`.

`return foo` results in `wfoo` of type `Wrap{Foo}`

#### _combinator_

Also known as _bind_ or _join_.

You have `wfoo` of type `Wrap{Foo}`.

You have a function `f` that takes `Foo` and returns `Wrap{Bar}`

`wfoo >>= f` results in `wbar` of type `Wrap{Bar}`

Basically, invalid/failure/other is captured during both unwrapping
and processing and preserved in the result.
You deal with it later.
