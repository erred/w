The art of living with _less_

Maybe it's satisfying that everything is clean and simple

## me

I remember reading an article in primary school on extreme minimalism,
an interview with college students living with little more than their suitcase,
_100_ things at most.
I thought it was an amazing idea,
but it would be years before I could start practicing it.

To me, minimalism serves 2 purposes,
1, to get _simplify_ life,
2, to make _moving_ easier.

## simplify

life's too short to clutter your mind with unimportant stuff,
throw them all away.

Do your _research_,
make your choice up front,
stick with it,
follow through and _reap_ the rewards

## moving

last time I counted I avergaed _~2 years_ between moving houses,
it's so much easier if you have less to lug around

who wants to drag boxes of stuff you never use around anyways

## digital

lean in on the _digital stuff_,
it doesn't take up space,
it can live in the cloud,
jus remember to periodically clean it our

## criticism

Luxury,
it can be more expensive if you're not careful,
chasing that shony new thing that will allow you to get rid of 2 serviceable things,

Plus it's only really possible in cities where stuff is convenient
