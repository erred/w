_authn_: authentication is proving your identity

_authz_: authorization is proving your permission to access something

# RBAC

role based access control

- every active thing (accessor) has an identity, commonly implemented as _service accounts_
- every passive things (accessed) has permissions needed to access them
- _roles_ are groups of permissions which can be assigned to identities

## GCP

_service accounts_ are assigned roles in the [iam/admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) page

_roles_ and their permissions can be edited in the [iam/roles](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles) page

## Kubernetes

_service accounts_ can be created through the `ServiceAccount` kind

_roles_ can be created through the `Role` and `ClusterRole` kinds

_roles_ can be assigned to service accounts through `RoleBinding` and `ClusterRoleBinding` kinds

# ACL

access control lists

similar to RBAC,
but directly maps permissions to users.
ACL with only groups is identical to RBAC

# in the wild

## _single_ key

Your access token / key is tied to your identity,
and sometimes limited in specific permissions,
examples:

- SSH key
- Magic link emails

## _multi_ key

You have a (public) stable id and a (volatile) secret,
examples:

- username + password
- id + secret
- id + access token: often you are given a long lasting refresh token used to obtain a short lived access token
