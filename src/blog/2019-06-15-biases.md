### TCK

Recently I was introduced to the term TCK or [Third Culture Kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid),
I think it adequately describes me

#### What bias?

We all have them,
it's just if you recoqnize them.

Things like _stereotypes_, and racism are very real,
and no matter how hard you try,
it's almost impossible to wipe them from your mind.

The best you can do is to be _aware_ of them,
catch them before you open your mouth or do something,
and make corrective actions

#### Politically correct

The most tiring form of correctness,
as you strive to offend _no one_,
but you gradually realize that _someone_ is always offended by _something_,
choose carefully,
cut your losses.
