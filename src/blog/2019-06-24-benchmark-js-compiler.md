ahh,
the _dumpster fire_ that is javascript,
still need it to get shit to run on the web,
how can it be so _slooooooooooooooooooooow_

# use case

multi page web things with javascript,
es6, firebase, recaptcha, grpc-web

# requirements

- no config

- fast

# result

js is still shit

they say they build tools for noobs but why do they all still need sooo much _config_

## parcel

58s

## webpack

needs too much config

## rollup

same
