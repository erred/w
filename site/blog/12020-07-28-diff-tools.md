### _diff_ tools

#### _12020-10-25_ update

[git-delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) is basically perfect

#### _orig_

I use git in a terminal, and I want:

- side by side diff
- colorful (red/green) diff
- no bloated dependencies

basically what Github has

#### _note_

git diff calls external tools with 7 args:

```txt
path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode
```

meaning in most cases you need a basic wrapper script
to pass just `$2` and `$5`

```sh
#!/bin/sh
your-diff-tool "$2" "$5"
```

#### _options_

_tldr_: side by side only with python or vim/nvim
