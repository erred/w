### _irc_

The server(s) don't keep history,
so you're responsible for staying online if you need it.
Kind of annoying you need a server for that.
And if you log in from 2 different places
you need 2 different names.

#### _plain_ weechat

- \+ No server
- \+ Local notifications possible
- \- No history
- \- No mobile support

#### _double_ weechat

One running as a relay / bouncer,
so you technically only have a single session
to the network.

- \+ History
- \+ Mobile
- \+ Local notifications
- \- Needs a server
- \- More complex / needs tuning

#### _screen_ weechat

Run weechat in a screen on a remote server,
connect through ssh and reattach screen.

- \+ History
- \+ Simpler than double weechat
- \- Needs a server
- \- No local notifications
- \- No mobile support
