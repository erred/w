### _LC_ALL_

Maybe at some point you set `LANG=en_US.UTF-8` and `LC_ALL=C`
because you read somewhere that `C` had faster sorting than `en_US.UTF-8`
(somewhat reasonable when you're dealing with large amounts of data).
and you set it in `zshenv`.

Maybe you then also start to wonder why your prompt gets messed up when you use
`Â»`

Also you wonder why emoji and other things don't work in your terminal
and you see a string of `<f0><9f><98><80>` or `???? ????` or similar

Wonder no more! set `LC_*` back to `en_US.UTF-8`
