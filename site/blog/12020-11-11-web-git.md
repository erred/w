### _web_ git

You've decided that git and ssh are all you need to host your own repos,
but you still want a way to show people the repo without making them clone it.
Or you think it's more convenient to have a ui to look at history and stuff.

Options:

### _gitweb_

Built into git, has a standalone mode or a fcgi mode.
Bare but functional design.
Ugly urls: `http://arch.seankhliao.com/?p=com-seankhliao.git;a=summary`

### cgit

Something you need to install, run with fgci or wsgi and a web server.
UI is like gitweb but a bit sleeker, pretty (normal) urls.

### git-webui

Some not very popular project (not packaged in ditribution repos).
For a single repo, modern ui, IDE like, allows you to work on git (I think).
Doesn't play nice with dark mode.

### stagit

Also not very popular thing.
Static site generator for git repos.
Only shows the latest commit on the default branch and diffs between adjacent commits
(otherwise there's a combinatoral explosion of possibilities).
An even barer interface than gitweb.
