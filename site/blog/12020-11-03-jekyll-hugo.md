### _static_ site generators

jekyll and hugo are the 2 big ones I know of.
They turn markdown into html
(and also do a bit more).

Hugo is architecturally less flexible,
but you get sensible things,
like autogenerated index pages,
while themes are just template/html/css bundles.

Jekyll is more flexible,
but also comes with a lot less.
I spent way too long trying to figure out how to generate index pages
(still don't know how)
or get it to recognize that I want my directories relfected in site navigation structure.
It's ruby, "themes" are more like fully fledged plugins
and I don't know why you would want to use it.
