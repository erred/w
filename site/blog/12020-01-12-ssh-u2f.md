### SSH _U2F_

hardware keys with ssh!

#### _compile_

install [Yubico/libfido2](https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2)

build [openssh/openssh-portable](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable)
with `-with-security-key-builtin` passed to `./configure`

#### generate _key_

notes:

- `ed25519-sk` support is apperently exotic?
  at least my _yubikey 5_ s don't support it
- `SSH_SK_PROVIDER` should not be set

```
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk
```

#### use

login as usual, you should be prompted to touch key
