### Inbox _Zero_

Treat your inbox as your things to do _now_
nothing more, nothing less

#### reducing load

To make life easier,
reduce the things coming into your inbox,
filter, mark as spam, and _unsubscribe_ are your friends

#### clearing the queue

For the emails already there,
search, filter, mark as read, archive

#### Incoming!

For everything coming in,
your options are:

- read, archive
- read, respond
- read, snooze (return to queue at later date)
- read, mark spam, unsubscribe, delete

with the end goal of clearing the queue and having done everything
