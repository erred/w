description: getting the matrix - irc bridge to work
title: matrix irc

### _matrix_

Decentralized, federated, encrypted, buzzword filled chat,
with a slow af ui.
And they have a bad habit of changing their named every few months.
Also I question their implementation of 2fa.

Whatever, the protocol is called _matrix_ and their web frontend is _element_.
What's it good for?
Not sure, but they advertise bridges to IRC

#### _bridging_ to freenode

Their bridge/bots are can be somewhat unresponsive,
solution is to wait a few days and try again.
A safe interaction to test responsiveness is to change nick with appservice

note the different type of syntax for the 2 bots.

Assuming you have an existing account on freenode

msg to [@freenode_NickServ:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_NickServ:matrix.org)

- `IDENTIFY username password`

msg to [@appservice-irc:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@appservice-irc:matrix.org)

- `!storepass password`
- `!nick newnick`
- `!join #channel`
