### Day _4_

last day at 36c3 / CCC,
people are tired,
things are starting to get cleaned up
Nothing interesting.

#### Life

For first year,
it was interesting.

For next time:
plan ahead to meet more people,
volunteering is probably a good idea.

#### Talks

##### HAL - The Open Source Hardware Analyzer

_Ok cool_
We're building a decompiler for hardware.
Okay, maybe not the most exciting things.

##### Understanding millions of gates

_Huh_
previous talk was not entirely correct.
btw, you can try to hid your stuff
but **it's not very effective**

##### Hackers & makers changing music technology

_Ehhh_
bit heavy on history,
expected a broader survey on current things
