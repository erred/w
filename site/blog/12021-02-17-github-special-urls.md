### _github_

For better or for worse, I spend a lot of time on github,
triaging issues (for [Go](https://github.com/golang/go))
and writing/reviewing pull requests (for [work](https://github.com/deBijenkorf)).

Apparently I never bothered to click the
[_Pull requests_](https://github.com/pulls)
or [_Issues_](https://github.com/issues)
tabs at the top of every page ðŸ¤¦.
Anyway, they're sort of useful,
though I still want a personal kanban / project board for organizing stuff,
without needing access to the repos and without littering timelines with status changes.
