### _package_ managers

Extensible! Modular!
uhh, it just means now I have X
different sets of packages I need to
keep up to date
or reinstall when I move machines.

- _pacman_ / _yay_: arch linux system wide
- _chrome_: extensions
- _neovim_ / _minpac_: editor plugins
- _coc.nvim_: editor completion plugins
- _gcloud_: google cloud sdk components
- _krew_: kubectl plugins
- _weechat_: irc client scripts
- _zsh_: zsh plugins
- _go_: the things installed with go get/install
- _cargo_: for rust
- _npm_: for js
- _pip_ / \$flavor of the day: for python
