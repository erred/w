I was a bit disappointed, I had no clean slate.

Social circles reached everywhere.

- WVS
- PA

##### High School

Before school started they called
and asked if I wanted to be put into a "special" class
for foriegn language learning.
I declined, because I preferred more science-y stuff.

I was put into the "randos" class,
half were students who had decided to do science+biology
(this was the more difficult track, because doctors)
and the other half hadn't decided what to do with their lives.
Although our class was all boys, we were a floor where the majority were girls.
This sort of affected in how "open" we could be.

I was in a club and despite the "science-y" name,
we just used that to collaborate across schools for events.
So I did a lot of event planning, and photography.
Usually I managed to weasel myself into some "special" position.
Anyways, what I was best at was reacting to the everchanging situations.

I pulled 18h days,
My day started at 0600,
a commute, studying before classes, classes till 1700,
socializing/studying (depend on year) till 2200
and usually gaming till 2400 for relaxation.
I was called a vampire/zombie quite a few times.

Gaming. My choice was Planetside 2, up to 1200 people per server
split into 3 factions fighting for territory.
I rose up the ranks and occasionally got to lead ~120 people platoons
that could shift the tides of war.

My coffee addiction started at the tail end of my time in high school.

##### Middle School

First school, I cried (a bit) on my first day.
I did make some (temporary) friends.

I was expelled for insulting the head teacher of our private school.
I compared him to Kim Jung Il.
I was praised for my english skill.

I continued to read, but now my reading had shifted to:
The Times, Financial Times
(occasionally, I didn't understand that much yet),
and The Economist.

I was homeschooled for a few months.
Progress flew by in maths/science.

I went to an international school.
I made 1 long term friend.
Also managed to skip a year in school.

I went to a swimming club and put into the non-competitive group.
Two memories stood out:
once I gave up halfway through a strenuous timed exercise,
the coach quickly dumped me back in, I pulled though;
the other was this girl in my lane,
we didn't really count as friends,
but it was one of the rare times I felt as an equal to someone.

##### Primary School

I remember even then
I preferred talking to teachers/adults.
There always seemed like so much
I could learn.
In my mind, somewhere in the future,
there would be a clearly defined moment
when you transitioned from "childhood" to "adulthood".
(hint: it never came.)

My mom tore up my notebooks if I didn't do well enough,
or locked me "outside" or in the walk in cabinet.
Of course I cried.

Apparently in the school play I preferred to boss people around,
than actually act in the play.

I learned to (was forced to) take notes.
We used pens, to enforce the idea of doing it right the first time.

I read. A lot.
I knew the contents of every book at home.
And my monthly reading consisted of Popular Science,
Scientific American, and National Geographic.
I thought I understood most of it.

I think this was the last period of my life where I actually was care-free,
and didn't have to constantly think/worry about the future.

##### Preschool

I was sent to a local russian preschool/daycare.
It was dark, I didn't speak the language,
there were oversized toys (trucks?).
I didn't make any friends.
I cried for the full 2 days I was there.

I was then sent to an international school.
I spoke english (somewhat).
The teachers were friendly,
I got along fine.

I didn't like movies/cartoons back then (I still don't).
I think I felt too much empathy
for the characters in them,
making the entire experience stressful.

##### before school

I have faint "memories",
though I'm not sure if they are real
or were synthesized through
photos, stories, and later experiences.

The only strong memory I have is of
climbing on/around the approx. 80 boxes
we had of our stuff when we moved to Moscow.
