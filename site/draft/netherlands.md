### _about_ me

Completed my bachelor's degree in Taiwan,
moved to the Netherlands for my Master's
(& hopefully a job after).

#### _notes_

- You don't really need to speak Dutch in Amsterdam.
- First priority is getting a Dutch bank account.
- Phone contracts are easier if you have both
  a local bank account and local ID.
- After you get a local phone number,
  go back and change the other numbers you registered (eg. bank).
- Once you're registered with the municipality
  and got your citizen service number (BSN) and phone number,
  register for [DigiD](https://www.digid.nl/digid-aanvragen-activeren#hoe-vraag-ik-digid-aan)
  to manage stuff online.
- Once you've got DigiD,
  register for [MijnOverheid](https://mijn.overheid.nl/)
  to receive most(?) gov mail digitally.
- Amsterdam housing is not easy to find.
  Especially if you don't have a job contract.
  Also don't start searching 2 weeks before you need to move.
- Amsterdam tech job market is very meh.
  Approx 100 companies worth applying for (pandemic mode).
  Total comp maybe 4x000 for a new grad.
