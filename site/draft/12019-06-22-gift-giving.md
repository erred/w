This is for you

### Why do we give

#### _Society_ says so

There are all sorts of occasions when it is expected to give something,
holidays, anniversaries, parties, major life events...
Finding something appropriate is _hard_

#### Value _exchange_

A somehow a more socially acceptable way of exchanging value,
that is not in the universal currency of \$\$\$.
_whyyyyyy_

#### I _feel_ like it

_Altrustic_ gift giving is apparently a contentious topic,
as in some people don't believe in it,
but yes,
it is possible

### I have something for _you_

I give only when I find that _near perfect match_ of gift to person,
and I'm usually too impatient to wait until the usual gift giving seasons,
**seriously they're not evenly distributed around the year**.

The only things I really expect are the immediate reactions,
_nothing_ more

### For me?

I always feel conflicted about receiving gifts,
I don't want to feel like I've pressure someone into getting something for me,
and I research every purchase of mine to death,
**I seriously doubt you will know me better than myself**

But also I appreciate the gesture,
even if I have no idea of what to do with it
