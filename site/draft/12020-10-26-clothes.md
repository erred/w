### _clothes_

Shopping is hard.
Finding something I actually find comfortable
and decent looking is even harder.

#### _head_

##### _mask_

Uniqlo AIRism Face Mask: black, medium

- Find something soft and comfortable for long sessions
- Kinda leaks around the nose bridge

Cashmere(?) scarf: thin, greenish

- Picked up some in Kashmir
- Okay, a bit thin sometimes, and not black

#### _upper_

##### _shirt_

Uniqlo AIRism Jersey Polo Shirt: black, medium

- A short sleeved, button down shirt
- Really like the material
- Comfortable enough to wear on its own
- Decently fast drying

##### _mid_ layers

H&M merino cardigan: zippered, black, medium

- Basically just a thin layer of wool
- Does its job, but liable to be replaced for something more functional

North Face fleece jacket: black, medium

- Can be an outer layer on non-rainy days
- Does its job, not very stylish and looks way oversized
- Pockets++ (giant side pockets, has left breast pocket)
- Also candidate for replacement for something more stylish

#### _outer_ layers

Rains Long Jacket: black, S/M

- Waterproof, decent looking and my only real outer layer

#### _hands_

##### _gloves_

Zara leather gloves: black

- Meh, keep your hands sort-of dry and not very warm
- No smartphone touch

North Face ETIP Gloves: black

- Touchscreens!
- Bit bulky for everyday use, negates touchscreen support

#### _legs_

##### _underwear_

Uniqlo AIRism boxers

- Cheap, comfy mesh
- Occasionally rides up/needs adjustment
- Thin and doesn't do much for smell

##### _pants_

Ministry of Supply ??? pants: black

- Really comfortable once you get used to them
- Needs replacing to wear and tear

Uniqlo tracksuit bottoms: gray

- Comfy, but not very stylish

#### _feet_

##### _socks_

Uniqlo cotton socks

- These suck tbh
- Constantly slip down

Darn Tough T4066

- Comfy, a bit thick for summer
- Darn hard to source/buy if outside US

##### _shoes_

Clarks leather chelsea: black

- Comfy
- But I might challenge them too much, soles (heels) about halfway gone after a year
