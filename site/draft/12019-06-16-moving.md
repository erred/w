### moving

On the road again,
I have a love-hate relationship with moving

#### Fresh start

wipe the slate mostly clean,
start again,

_love_: you get to try stuff again,
learning from past mistakes

_hate_: you're starting from zero,
or 0.1,
the most tiring of which if building a network of friends

#### Spring clean

I don;t think I've ever moved in the _spring_,
but you get the idea,
reevaluate the stuff you own,
throw stuff out,
maybe you'll discover that long lost _sock_

#### friends

despite the _internet_,
friendship is still very much tied to _proximity_,
moving away you get to see which ones die off,
which ones to let go of,
and which will form the basis of long-lasting _bonds_
